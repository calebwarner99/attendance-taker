# attendance-taker
Google AppScript program designed to run as an extension of a Google Sheets file and automatically record attendance data gathered from a Google Form

This code project was developed in a Google Sheets AppScript project, and worked for use with my position with Reformed University Fellowship
for taking attendance at gatherings. It belongs there, but it is here to both showcase my programming abilities, as well as make it public for use with others.
